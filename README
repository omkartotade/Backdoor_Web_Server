Description-



normal_web_server is a regular HTTP 1.1 server that can be used to service normal HTTP 1.1 requests.

The catch here is, it acts as a backdoor which pretends to be a web server. This can be beneficial to hackers. A similar system can be hidden somewhere on a server to make it a backdoor for the hackers to hack into the system and execute any shell command.


My program accepts valid HTTP 1.1 requests, and responds to them with 200 OK replies. In case the request is not a valid HTTP 1.1 or a GET request, the program responds by sending a 404 Not Found response.


For valid HTTP 1.1 requests, the program basically looks for the /exec/ keyword and executes the command that follows /exec/ in linux shell and responds with the output of the command.

For every valid request the program responds with a 'HTTP/1.1 200 OK' response and for every invalid request it responds with a 'HTTP/1.1 Not Found' response.

The program can also handle multiple client requests simultaneously.
